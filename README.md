Hong Kong Political Prisoners Database is an Open-Source, public database of political prisoners in Hong Kong. 

The initial data-set was curated from Hong Kong Watch (https://www.hongkongwatch.org/) and The Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation (https://www.thecfhk.org/).

Initial use of this database: 香港萬象 (https://www.hkers.social/)

## Format

The database is currently in standard json format in English with provision for Chinese translations. It can easily be imported into a NoSQL database such as MongoDB.

It is intended to be corrected, updated, and extended. Ideas include (but not limited to):

- Contact Information (jail address etc)
- Links to court cases
- Better photos (High resolution public domain photos)
