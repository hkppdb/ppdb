On 15 February 2022, Yuen was arrested on suspicion of acting with seditious intent and money laundering. According to Senior Superintendent Steve Li of the National Security Department, Yuen’s social media posts formed the basis of the police’s enforcement actions. He said that “looking at these posts, the only conclusion we can make is that he hopes to incite citizens’ hatred of the government through such seditious language and photos.” He also performed a song containing the protest slogan “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times” during an online concert. According to Li, the slogan “means separatism,” as mentioned in the Tong Ying-kit case, “if the guy sings this song … that would be inciting others to do some illegal acts.” On 17 February 2022, Yuen was officially charged on one count of committing an act or acts with seditious intention. He was transferred to the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts. Yuen’s application for bail was denied after Magistrate Andy Cheng Lim-chi concluded that there were insufficient grounds to believe that Yuen would not continue to commit acts endangering national security if bail was approved.",

    "summary": "Lui was accused of using his residence as an arsenal, collecting pepper balls, air guns and other items, and commenting on Hong Kong independence on the Telegram channel. At the original trial, he pleaded guilty to 'inciting subversion of state power' and two counts of unlicensed possession of firearms and possession of offensive weapons were filed in court. Regarding sentencing, the judge said that the case was 'serious' and that the defendant incited Hong Kong independence through Telegram channels. The defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years and eight months of imprisonment. The prosecution immediately suggested that the National Security Law includes the crime of 'inciting subversion of state power'. The minimum sentence for serious cases is five years in prison, and the judge finally commuted the sentence to 5 years after consideration. In other words, although the defendant pleaded guilty, he could not obtain a commutation of one-third of the sentence.",
